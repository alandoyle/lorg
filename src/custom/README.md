## Setup

For **Standalone** installations copy the *custom.css* from the *Docker* folder to this folder.
If running under *Docker* then this is taken care of automatically.

### Custom Logo
A custom logo can be used by copying *logo.svg* to this folder and performing any custom CSS rules in *custom.css* to adjust padding/margins/size/etc.

### Custom robots.txt
By default **lorg** has a *robots.txt* which prevents indexing. If you wish to override it then copy a new *robots.txt* here.

## Custom favicon.ico
By default **lorg** has a generic *favicon.ico*. If you wish to override it then copy a new *favicon.ico* here.
